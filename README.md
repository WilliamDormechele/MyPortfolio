## 🌟 About

I am a highly motivated and detail-oriented data professional with over 5 years of experience in data science, data management, and software development. I specialize in transforming complex datasets into actionable insights, building robust data pipelines, and developing web-based tools to support decision-making in health research, development, and enterprise environments.

With a strong foundation in Python, SQL, STATA, R, Power BI, and modern web technologies (Flask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jinja2), I have led projects ranging from health data analytics to end-to-end software development for SOP management and research ethics systems.
